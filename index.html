   <h3>CS 370 Final Project – Reinforcement Learning Agent</h3>
  <p>
    This project demonstrates an AI agent that utilizes reinforcement learning (RL) principles. 
    The agent learns to navigate an environment and make decisions based on rewards and penalties, 
    balancing exploration and exploitation to optimize its behavior.
  </p>
  <p>
    For this project, I built on provided starter code and adjusted the Q-train training loop. 
    I implemented learning value updates and produced progress reports every 10 wins, 
    allowing us to monitor and improve the agent’s decision-making. 
    I also experimented with different parameters, including the learning rate, discount factor, 
    and exploration rate, to enhance agent performance while ensuring a fair balance between exploration and exploitation.
